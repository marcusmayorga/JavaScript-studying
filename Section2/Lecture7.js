/* 
CONCEPTUAL ASIDE

Big Word Alert:

Syntax Parser - A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if it's grammar is valid.

The Code isn't magic. Someone else wrote a program to translate it for the computer. Compilers or interpreters.

Your code is not what's actually being given to the computer but a translation of it.

Big Word Alert:

Lexical Environment - Where something sits physically in the code you write.

'Lexical' means 'having to do with words or grammar.' A lexical environment exists in programming languages in 
which WHERE you write something is important.

The compiler cares about where you put things.

Big Word Alert:

Execution Context - A wrapper to help manage the code that is running.

There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts. 
It can contain things beyond what you've written in your code.
